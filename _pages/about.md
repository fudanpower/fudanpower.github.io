Dr. Liu currently is a full professor of School Microelectronics at Fudan University, China. He graduated in 2009 from the Department of Microelectronics at Fudan University with a Ph.D. in Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics. He conducted postdoctor research, from 2009-2012, on micro-nano electronic devices and processes, failure analysis, and wide-bandgap semiconductor power device fabrication at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology. From 2012 to 2015, he was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and served as a JSPS Special Research Fellow in Department of Materials Engineering at School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan. After that, he joined School of Microelectronics at Fudan University as an Associate Professor under the talent recruitment program.

He has published over 100 academic papers in top conferences and journals such as IEEE IEDM, EDL/T-ED, with more than 2500 citations. He has applied for 20 patents, with 5 granted. He co-authored the book "Microelectronics of Thin Film Transistors" and serves as a reviewer for journals such as Nano Letters, IEEE EDL/T-ED. He is a member of IEEE and the Japan Society of Applied Physics, a guest editor for Nanoscale Research Letters and Nanomaterials, and has received several awards, including the "Pujiang Talent Program" in 2016, the "Zhong Yang" Innovation Team in 2018, and was recognized as an expert by the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission and the Jiangsu Province Industrial Technology Research Institute in 2021.

Our research group specializes in gallium oxide power devices design and fabrication, as well as hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric transistors/memories, and reliability studies, among other areas. Our goal is to push forward semiconductor and integrated circuit technology, making significant contributions to both academic and industrial sectors. We're seeking talented students with backgrounds in microelectronics, electronic engineering, and physics to be part of our team.
